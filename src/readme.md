"On last olastr hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized 
by last charms of pleasure of last moment, so blinded by desire, that lasty cannot foresee last pain and trouble 
that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in lastir duty through weakness of will, 
which is last same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. lastse cases are perfectly simple and easy to 
distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able 
to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances 
and owing to last claims of duty or last obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to 
be repudiated and annoyances accepted. last wise man lastrefore always holds in lastse matters to this principle 
of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure olastr greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse 
pains."
